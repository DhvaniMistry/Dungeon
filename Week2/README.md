# Dungeon Load/Save

**Course**: COM S 3270 â€“ Spring 2025

**Project**: Programming Project 1.02


## Overview

This project adds **file I/O capabilities** to the dungeon generator from Programming Project 1.01. It introduces support for **saving** and **loading** dungeons using a binary file format, enabling persistent dungeon state and consistent testing against static outputs. It supports PC positioning and includes logic for managing dungeon metadata such as room and staircase counts.

## Features

* **Generate**, **load**, and/or **save** dungeons
* Dungeon is stored in the hidden directory: `~/.rlg327/dungeon`
* Supports command-line arguments:

  * `--save`: Save dungeon after generation or load
  * `--load`: Load dungeon from disk instead of generating a new one
  * Can be used together (i.e., `--load --save`)
* Compliant binary dungeon file format with support for:

  * **PC location**
  * **Hardness map** for every cell
  * **Room list** with location and size
  * **Staircase lists** (up and down)
* Dungeon format is **portable**:

  * All data stored in **network byte order** (big-endian)
  * Should load files generated by any other correct implementation
* PC (`@`) displayed at the top-left of the first room (optional visual feature)


## Compilation & Usage

```bash
make
./dungeon               # Generate new dungeon
./dungeon --save        # Generate and save
./dungeon --load        # Load from disk
```


## Design Notes

* Dungeon data is organized as a set of C structures for clarity and modularity
* `getenv("HOME")` is used to build the save path, ensuring user independence
* Memory safety and bounds checking are emphasized when reading/writing files
* `htons`, `htonl`, `ntohs`, `ntohl` used for endian conversion

## Known Limitations

* Dungeon file is overwritten on every save (no versioning or backup)
* Max room count in generated dungeon is fixed, but **load supports arbitrary counts**



I am not able to manipulate the different levelof hardness and display corridors and  stairs. SOrry about that. I tried debugging but need some help.
