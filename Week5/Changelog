### Changelog


##### March 26, 2025
- **Movement Commands**:
  - Defined action mappings for each movement key.

##### March 25, 2025
- **Movement Logic**:
  - Fixed issue where pressing any key would reset the player's character (PC) position to the top-left corner.
  - Adjusted movement logic for correct updating of the PC's position based on keypress inputs.
  - Improved validation to ensure the PC only moves if the target position is valid (e.g., on the floor or valid terrain).

- **Stairs Functionality**:
  - Implemented functional stairs movement (`<` for up and `>` for down) that triggers dungeon regeneration.
  - PC will now properly reset the dungeon and monsters when using stairs, based on the specified behavior of regenerating new dungeons for each level.
  - Ensured the stairs logic only triggers when the PC is on a valid staircase tile.

##### March 23, 2025
- **Bug Fixes**:
  - **Bug Fix**: Fixed the issue where the PC's position would reset to the top-left corner (0, 0) after every keypress.
  - **Bug Fix**: Corrected terrain validation logic to ensure the PC doesnâ€™t move to invalid positions (e.g., walls or inaccessible areas).

##### March 23, 2025
- **Initial Work**:
    - Started removing the automatic generation of dungeon from old code.

#### Over the spring break
- Had to understand how to implement the monster feature and tried to understand what the instructor's code is doing.
